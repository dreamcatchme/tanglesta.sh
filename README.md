## Usage

After starting the application you might first want to setup your node provider.\
This is pre-set to `localhost` which means that you would need to run
[IRI](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) (the node software) on your own computer.\
A tutorial to setup a node can be found here:
https://iota.readme.io/v1.2.0/docs/install-iri or http://iota.partners/ \
\
Although, the easier way is to use a node providing service for the public from here: https://iota.dance/nodes \
After setting everything up you can either start retrieving a file that
was persisted in the past using its `Entry Hash` or persist a new file onto the tangle!\
\
Here's an `Entry Hash` to test the application. It's an image so you need to save it as a `.jpg` file. It's not encrypted.

## Disclaimer

I know that primarily the persisting to the tangle is painfully slow compared to a traditional HTTP upload.\
Keep in mind though that this project is more of a proof-of-concept rather than a finished product.\
The reason that it takes so long is mainly the current speed of the PoW, which might get faster in the future with new techniques.
